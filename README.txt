MIDTERM PROJECT - SPEED REVERSAL MULTIPLAYER MOD
-------------------------------------------------------



NOTE: PLEASE ADD THIS TO CONFIG.CFG -->  bind f "dash"



***********************************************************************************
Main Deliverables promised at beginning of project:
1) Dashing Function
	-Revolutionize movement

2) Slow-motion projectile weapons
	-Offset to quick movement, changes weapon behavior and use

3) Force Field (Knockback Weapon)
	-Allows for defensive escaping and offesive trapping
***********************************************************************************



Basic premise of mod – Multiplayer game mode that will essentially 
switch the speeds of movement and weapons.  This will create a scenario 
where strategic shooting and movement is key to not only trap your opponent 
but to also evade being trapped.



Gameplay proves to be fast-paced, dynamic, and strategic.  Newer areas
of the maps are now accessible, and traversing the environment can be more 
creative and exciting.  Ammunition is more about trap setting as 
opposed to shooting at your enemies.  Predicting enemy behavior and 
out-maneuvering them is key to survive and score.  Also, weapons have 
newfound strengths and weaknesses that were not applicable in
regular gameplay, which allows previously untouched weapons to have a new
spotlight, while more frequently used ones take a bit of a backseat.
